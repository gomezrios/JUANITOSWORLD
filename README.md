<p id="Alaskan_Anthem"><strong>Eight stars of gold on a field of blue<br>
Alaska's flag. May it mean to you<br>
The blue of the sea, the evening sky,<br>
The mountain lakes, and the flow'rs nearby<br>
The gold of the early sourdough's dreams,<br>
The precious gold of the hills and streams<br>
The brilliant stars in the northern sky,<br>
The "Bear" - the "Dipper" - and, shining high,<br>
The great North Star with its steady light,<br>
Over land and sea a beacon bright.<br>
Alaska's flag - to Alaskans dear,<br>
The simple flag of a last frontier.</strong><br></p>

<p>There are many myths made by the Alaskan Natives but I will only tell you about one mythical beast, <strong>Kushtaka,</strong> Kushtaka is a mythical beast said to be an Otter with shape shifting powers and killing Alaskan Natives or also turning them into a Kushtaka.The Kushtaka mostly appears when people get lost or hurt in the woods making them look like they are helping the person, but then when they are leading the person to saftey they actually lead them to a lake to a watery grave, some people in the Northwest territories depict the Kushtaka as a nice beast helping people. But this won't stop you from visiting Alaska, the thing Kushtaka is most afraid of are dogs, so bring a dog on your hike, some other <strong>AWESOME</strong> mythical beast from Alaska are...
